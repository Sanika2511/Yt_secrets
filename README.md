## **Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to analyze YouTube channel performance data and build a predictive model to estimate revenue based on video metrics such as views, watch time, engagement rate, and ad impressions. The project includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Predictive modeling using Linear Regression and Random Forest

---

## **Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is `youtube_channel_real_performance_analytics.csv`. It contains the following key columns:
- **Views**: Number of views for each video
- **Watch Time (hours)**: Total watch time in hours
- **Subscribers**: Number of subscribers gained/lost
- **Likes**: Number of likes
- **New Comments**: Number of new comments
- **Shares**: Number of shares
- **Ad Impressions**: Number of ad impressions
- **Video Duration**: Duration of the video in ISO 8601 format
- **Estimated Revenue (USD)**: Revenue generated by the video
- **Video Publish Time**: Timestamp of when the video was published

---

## **Features**
### **Engineered Features**
- **Revenue per View**: Revenue divided by views
- **Engagement Rate**: Sum of likes, comments, and shares divided by views
- **Publish Hour/Day/Month/Year**: Extracted from `Video Publish Time`
- **Day of Week**: Day of the week extracted from `Video Publish Time`
- **Video Duration (Seconds)**: Video duration converted to seconds
- **Duration Category**: Videos categorized as `Short`, `Medium`, or `Long` based on duration

---

## **Dependencies**
To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `isodate`

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn isodate
```

## **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sanika2511/Yt_secret.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Yt_secret
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## **Usage**
1. Place your dataset (`youtube_channel_real_performance_analytics.csv`) in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Yt_secret.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to:
   - Clean and preprocess the data
   - Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Train and evaluate the predictive model

---

## **Results**
### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Distribution of `Estimated Revenue (USD)` and `Views`
- Log-transformed distributions of revenue and views
- Monthly revenue trends

### **Model Performance**
- **Linear Regression**:
  - MSE: 29.334230486818555
  -R2 Score: 0.6630816660177035

- **Feature Importance**:
  - Top features influencing revenue: Views, Watch Time (hours), Subscribers, Engagement Rate, Ad Impressions, Video Duration, Playback-Based CPM (USD), Ad Impressions
